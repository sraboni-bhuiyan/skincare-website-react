I suffer from keratosis pilaris mostly on my arms but I have a little on my cheeks, but i have an oily t zone. I'd been using an SA cream for a while and this cleanser has worked so much better. My skin looks clearer than it has been in a long time"

Doesn't irritate my skin, small amount is enough foam to clean whole face, I like it. I use this only in the morning, as I'm using retinol at night. My hormonal acne reduce a bit since I started using this (been using for almost a month)"
